          The fat burning zone theory seeks to help adherents lose weight by tapping on the body's fat storage rather than glycogen. They argue that the body burns a greater percentage of fat with lower-intensity exercises than at higher intensities because the body does not require 'fast energy' from glycogen. As such, this theory promotes longer and lower-intensity cardio workouts that maintain your heart rate within the 'fat burning zone'.

However, that is a bit of a misconception. While it is true that the body burns fat during low-intensity workouts, the fat burning rate remains low and you have to exercise longer to burn the same amount of calories you would at higher intensities
